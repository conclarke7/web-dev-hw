I was cool to learn all the different ways you can change your site by editing text and even making buttons. My biggest struggle was typing hmlt instead of html
Im excited to see different ways you can break up your page and maybe do more with tables and style
I watched the walkthrough and found where my mistake was and fixed it of course I typed hmlt instead of html.
