      <h2>A Brother's Grimm Tale</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had
          a beautiful daughter. Now it happened that he had
          to go and speak to the king, and in order to make
          himself appear important he said to him, “I have
          a daughter who can spin straw into gold."</p>
        <p>The king said to the miller, “that is an art which
           pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as
           you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I
           will put her to the test.”</p>
